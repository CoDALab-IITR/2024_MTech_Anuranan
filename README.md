Brief description: Automation of generating results for multiple test cases by running one heuristic method.

Code description: 
 
 i. Importing Qiskit files & mqt tool of qmap.
 
 ii. Manual random arbitrary 5 qubits quantum architecture is formed.
 
 iii. 10 qasm benchmark quantum circuits stored in the test cases.

 iv. Loop for generating a visualization of quantum circuits & heuristic mapping with quantum architecture taken from the input file.

 v. Storing visualization in the output.
